# Interview

This repository stores interviews I've completed, including algorithm exercises, system design, project, behavioral/cultural fit, and hiring manager interviews. It also includes practicing exercises and questions I've done.

This is not yet a complete list, as I only started documenting them recently.

The goal is to build a comprehensive repository to showcase my experience to companies and that I'm prepared, reducing the need to repeatedly prove myself in interviews and potentially skipping stages in the hiring process.
